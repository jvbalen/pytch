PYTCH
-----

Python toolkit for performance-invariant popular music fingerprinting and song description. Intended for applications in
music analysis and large-scale cover song retrieval.

*Note*: this version may differ slightly in implementation from descriptions of PYTCH in unpublished papers,
    but its structure and most of the functionality are stable.

Imports Numpy and Scipy, and possibly pandas for i/o.

Under development.
